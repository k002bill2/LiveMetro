# Feature Implementation Plans

This directory contains phase-based implementation plans for LiveMetro features.

## Purpose

Plans generated here follow the **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** methodology with:
- **Red-Green-Refactor** cycles for each phase
- Quality gates between phases
- Test coverage requirements
- Rollback strategies

## Plan Structure

Each plan follows this format:
```
PLAN_<feature-name>.md
├── Overview & Success Criteria
├── Architecture Decisions
├── Test Strategy
├── Implementation Phases
│   ├── Phase 1: Foundation (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
│   ├── Phase 2: Core Feature
│   ├── Phase 3: Enhancement
│   └── ...
├── Quality Gates (per phase)
├── Risk Assessment
├── Rollback Strategy
└── Progress Tracking
```

## How Plans Are Created

Plans are automatically generated by the **cc-feature-implementer-main** skill when:
- You request to "plan a feature"
- You ask to "break down" implementation work
- You mention "roadmap", "strategy", or "phases"
- You work on files in this directory

## Quality Gate Standards

Each phase must pass these validations before proceeding:

### Build & Tests
```bash
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
npm test              # All tests pass
npm test:coverage     # Coverage thresholds met
```

### Code Quality
```bash
npm run lint          # ESLint passes
```

### Manual Testing
- Feature works as expected
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Edge cases validated

## Example Usage

```
User: "I need to plan the train congestion feature"
↓
Claude activates cc-feature-implementer-main skill
↓
Generates: docs/plans/PLAN_train-congestion.md
↓
User approves plan
↓
Implementation begins with Phase 1
```

## Plan Templates

Plans use the template from:
`.claude/skills/cc-feature-implementer-main/plan-template.md`

## Notes

- ✅ Check off tasks as you complete them
- 📅 Update "Last Updated" date after each phase
- 📝 Document learnings in the Notes section
- ⚠️ Never skip quality gates
