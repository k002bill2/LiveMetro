# General Best Practices

## 1. Planning is Essential
-   **Never start coding without a plan.**
-   Use `task-master` or simple markdown lists to outline steps.
-   Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.

## 2. Use the "Dev Docs" System
-   Treat documentation as the AI's long-term memory.
-   Update `architecture.md` and `guideline.md` when making significant changes.
-   Read these docs at the start of a session to load context.

## 3. Context Management
-   Use `/clear` to reset context between distinct tasks.
-   Don't overload the context with unnecessary files. Use `view_file` selectively.
-   If the AI gets stuck or confused, clear context and restate the problem with fresh information.

## 4. Code Quality
-   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Refactor repeated logic into functions/components.
-   **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**: Keep functions and components focused.
-   **Testing**: Write tests for critical logic.
